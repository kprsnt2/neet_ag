It typically lasts 28 days (can range from 21-35 days) and consists of four phases:\n\n1. **Menstrual Phase (Days 1-5)**: The uterine lining (endometrium) sheds, causing menstrual bleeding. Hormone levels (estrogen and progesterone) are low.\n\n2. **Follicular Phase (Days 1-13)**: FSH from the pituitary stimulates ovarian follicles. The dominant follicle produces estrogen, which rebuilds the endometrium.\n\n3. **Ovulation (Day 14)**: LH surge causes the mature follicle to release the ovum. This is the most fertile period.\n\n4. **Luteal Phase (Days 15-28)**: The corpus luteum forms and produces progesterone, maintaining the endometrium for potential implantation.\n\nKey hormones: FSH, LH (from pituitary), Estrogen, Progesterone (from ovaries).\nNEET Important: Know the hormone levels during each phase and their sources.",

This explains the 3:1 ratio in F2 generation.\n\n3. **Law of Independent Assortment**: Genes for different traits assort independently during gamete formation (applies when genes are on different chromosomes).\n\nMonohybrid Cross: Tt x Tt → TT:Tt:tt = 1:2:1 (genotypic), 3:1 (phenotypic)\nDihybrid Cross: 9:3:3:1 ratio in F2\n\nNEET Important: Practice Punnett squares and understand incomplete dominance (1:2:1 phenotypic ratio) and codominance (both alleles express).",
